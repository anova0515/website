abstract: "How do scientist labor markets respond to an influx of highly skilled workers? Newly trained scientists may compete with incumbent scientists in the labor market driving down their wages. At the same time incumbent scientists may receive knowledge spillovers from new scientists, making them more productive and increasing their earnings. In this paper we measure how the arrival of new scientists affected the earnings of incumbent scientists in the same local labor market. We utilize highly detailed panel data on thousands of scientists collected during the 1960s to quantify these effects. We propose a shift-share identification strategy that utilizes established university specific locational networks coupled with university level shocks in degree production over time. Our analysis reveals three findings. First, using within scientist variation in the number of new graduates in their labor market, we find positive effects from the number of recent doctoral graduates in a labor market. Second, the positive spillover effects of local doctoral graduates are much stronger for lower skilled scientists than higher skilled. Third, the positive spillover effects are much stronger for low income and less experienced scientists who may have the most to learn from highly skilled arrivals. Thus, the production of doctoral degrees led scientists' earnings to converge during the Space Race era."

summary: "We investigate how scientistsâ€™ outside options affect their wages and knowledge production. Our results shows that the abrupt end of draft deferrals for American graduate students in 1967 sharply changed
the outside option of young working male scientists. A triple difference analysis reveals scientist wages are sensitive to outside option changes, but their knowledge production is not."
