abstract: "We investigate how scientists’ outside options affect their wages and knowledge production. We document
how the abrupt end of draft deferrals for American graduate students in 1967 sharply changed
the outside option of young working male scientists. A triple difference analysis reveals scientist
wages are sensitive to outside option changes, but their knowledge production is not."
