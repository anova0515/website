abstract: "This paper investigates the impact of air pollution on the quality of decisions in a bounded rationality setting. I exploit randomly occurring dust storms to quantify the effect of air pollution on cognitive performance of players of the strategy board game Go. I benchmark the quality of moves played by humans against move evaluations from a powerful Go artificial intelligence. My results show that particulate matter (PM) exposure increases blundering in game. This effect grows almost linearly with age; a 30 year old player experiences 15% more blunders with a PM shock of 75 micrograms per cubic meter, corresponding to a typical dust storm. Age asymmetric effects translate to game outcomes favoring younger players during dust storm days."
