abstract: I use the early twentieth-century establishment of commercial radio in the United States to quantify the impact of locally relevant farm programming on productivity growth. Using variation in exposure to radio due to topography, my analysis shows that the broadcasting of local farm programming led to an increase in the productivity of land used in agriculture that persisted for at least two decades. This positive effect was not limited to a certain region, and was felt in a variety of important crops grown across the country. Consistent with radio reducing information barriers, the productivity gains were more pronounced for farmers on areas with lower literacy rates and economic status, lower media saturation, and reduced transport connectivity via railroads.
